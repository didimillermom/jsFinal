    <h3 class="sectionBanner">Arrays</h3>
    <p class="color"><span class="tab"></span>There are so many thing that you can do with arrays. An array is a list of
        like items that you can use to create all kinds of fun things. Let's use an array of colors and a random function to change the background color!

    <h4>Click the button to change the Background color.</h4>
    <button id="button1">Change</button>

    <p class="color">
        -<br>

    <h3 class="sectionBanner">Dom Manipulation Using createElement and appendChild</h3>

    <p class="hideme color"><span class="tab"></span>Dom stands for Document Object Module. This is a
        representation of
        the
        web page or HTLM
        that you are working with. It is kind of like a family tree with each of the objects of an HTML page represented.
        Attached is an image from wikipedia showing and example of DOM Tree: The top Element is the actual HTML
        Document and is considered to be the root node, next down are the Elements nodes, Text nodes and
        Attribute nodes. According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla
                        .org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node" target="_blank">MDN</a> a node is simply the interface of the element
        in the DOM.
    </p>

        <p class="color">So, when we are talking about modifying the DOM we are talking about modifying objects
            in an
            HTLM document. The DOM is not actually part of JavaScript but is a built-in API(application programming
            interface). </p>

        <p class="color"><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp" target="_blank">W3
            School</a>
            explains many of the DOM manipulation types and defines createElement "Creates an Element node". It also states
            that appendChild "Adds a new child node, to an element, as the last child node". As you can see in the previous
            image, element nodes are part of the tree that are in blue. The child elements would be text nodes or in our
            case the Element is the UL and the child is the li. Elements are things like "body, paragraphs, lists,and fonts.
        </p>

        <p class="color">The first thing we will try to do is create a new list item in the Unordered list that has been
            created in HTML. We will use both the createElement and appendChild methods to change the child of the UL. </p>
